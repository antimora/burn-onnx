# Sum

Since opset **13**

## Description

Element-wise sum of each of the input tensors (with Numpy-style broadcasting support).
All inputs and outputs must have the same data type.
This operator supports **multidirectional (i.e., Numpy-style) broadcasting**; for more details please check [the doc](Broadcasting.md).

## Inputs (1 - 2147483647)

- **data_0** (T, variadic): List of tensors for sum.

## Outputs (1 - 1)

- **sum** (T): Output tensor.

## Type Constraints

- **T**: tensor(bfloat16), tensor(double), tensor(float), tensor(float16)
  Constrain input and output types to float tensors.
